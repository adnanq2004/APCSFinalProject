[Project Prototype]

[Project Description]
  [Brief Project Description]
  The overall project is gonna be mainly a Pacman clone. You start off in the center of the screen, and must navigate through a maze full of collectibles, just like in Pacman, and you must collect all of the collectibles on a level to move on. Enemies will exist that may kill you. If you die, you will be sent back to the center of the maze, and your life counter will tick down by one. Once your life counter reaches 0, a “Game Over” screen will be displayed, and the player will probably have an option to play again from the first level. The player will most likely be able to outspeed the enemies, but will need to perfectly maneuver around the board. The "extra features" we plan to add are going ot be customized enemies. In the normal Pacman game, there are commonly four enemy "ghosts" around the board. We plan on replacing these enemies with unique enemies inspired by characters from "Arknights". We will also either eliminate the ability to temporarily stop the "ghost" enemies, or balance it in some other way.
  [Critical Features]
  We should have at least a working level 1 by the end of the week. It should have the first level, as well as a movable player Pacman, and romaing enemies that, when within a certain radius of the Pacman, will kill him.
  [Nice to Have Features]
  It would be nice to have more than just one level done, and possibly our selection of enemies finalized, and large enough to have more than a few throughout our levels.
